      "content": "Yeah, that kind of pressure can build really quickly in engineering roles. Are you able to push back on any of the timelines?"

      "content": "I mean, yes and no? I get a lot done, but then my sleep gets totally messed up and I feel anxious the next day. It's like a cycle."
    },
    {
      "turn": 8,
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That sounds frustrating - being productive but then dealing with the fallout. Have you noticed anything that helps break that cycle?"

      "turn": 9,
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Exercise, definitely. Like, I've noticed my mood just drops when I skip running for a few days. It's pretty obvious."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That makes sense - the combination of movement and being outdoors can be really grounding."

      "turn": 13,
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Music helps too. I mostly listen to lo-fi or instrumental tracks while working. Can't deal with lyrics when I'm coding."

      "role": "assistant",

      "turn": 16,
      "role": "assistant",

      "turn": 17,
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Exactly. Sometimes I just want someone to listen instead of immediately trying to fix things."

    {
      "turn": 18,
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That makes sense. Being heard without the pressure to solve everything right away can be important."

      "turn": 21,
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I think it's just... no work pressure yet? Like Saturday I'm still recovering, but Sunday morning feels peaceful. Anyway, I'm actually considering switching to a less intense team in a few months."

      "turn": 23,
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Honestly? Relieved just thinking about it. Oh, and just so you know - I prefer conversations like this. Calm, not too many questions at once."
    },
    {
      "turn": 24,
      "role": "assistant",

      "content": "I live alone, so I think work stress tends to echo more, you know? Like there's no one to bounce things off of when I get home."
    },
    {
      "turn": 26,
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That can definitely make stressful periods feel heavier - not having that immediate outlet or connection."

      "turn": 29,
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I appreciate that. I think I want this to feel like a steady presence, not like... a life coach or therapist trying to optimize me, if that makes sense?"
